## What are MicroMirrors?

MicroMirrors are small managed appliances providing download edge capacity for free software projects and their self-hosted CDNs.
When you click on the download link for a piece of free software, their website will redirect you to one of their download mirrors, and we're adding as much network capacity as possible for those downloads to be fast for all users.

## Why is my computer accessing your server?

We host downloads for many major projects like VLC, GIMP, etc, so we're not hacking your computer; something on your computer is just downloading updates.
We do take any reports of abuse or issues seriously, so if you still really think that something is amiss, please contact us and provide specifics on which MicroMirror server you're looking at, what URL your computer was unexpectedly accessing, and what about this is concerning to you.

## What are Linux/Free Software download mirrors?

Free software projects typically don't have the budget to pay for their own whole CDN to provide downloads to users, so they rely on volunteers to host copies of the project files for user download.
Traditionally these download mirrors have >50TB of storage to host all the major projects and all their files, where our MicroMirrors are not trying to cover the whole field but only host the highest demand fraction of the projects.
